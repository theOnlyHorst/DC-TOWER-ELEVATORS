## DC Tower Elevators (IBM Coding Challenge)
This is my attempt at the DC Tower Elevators IBM Coding Challenge.
This is designed to be a simple implementation of all requested features.
The simulation of this challenge is done synchronously due to my own limited experience with Asynchronous processes with Java.

Running the Program from the Start.java entry point goes through a few test cases that check the functionality of each feature.


The Program was run with the following Settings:
* OS: Windows 10
* Java Runtime: OpenJDK 17.0.1
* IDE: IntelliJ Community Edition
